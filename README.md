# Pentago

## About

This is an implementation of the *Pentago* board game in Python.

Pentago is a two-player game played on a 6×6 board split into four 3×3 quadrants. Players take turns placing a marble and rotating one quadrant. The goal is to get **five marbles in a row**.

The game supports two modes:

* Human vs Human 
* Human vs Computer

## How the game works

On each turn, a player:

1. Places a marble on an empty cell
2. Rotates one quadrant by 90°

The game ends when:

* A player gets five in a row, or
* The board is full
